# What are Web APIs?
_2 min read_

There are various types of APIs and standards, such as hardware APIs, operating system APIs, package APIs,  web APIs, etc. Among them, **Web APIs** are perhaps the most widely discussed. In fact, the term "API" has become so closely associated with web APIs that many in the software industry use "API" to refer specifically to web APIs.

Web APIs are designed to perform CRUD operation over the internet, hence the name. Since the dawn of internet standards have been developed to build web APIs and the **REST** stands out amoung all. REST stands for Representational State Transfer which uses HTTP protocol to comsmunicate across internet.

RESTful refers to an API that adheres to the REST Standards. REST and RESTful are often used interchangeably.
